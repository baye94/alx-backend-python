# Generator to Stream SQL Rows

This project sets up a MySQL database `ALX_prodev`, seeds it with user data from a CSV, and includes a Python generator to stream rows from the table `user_data`.

## Usage

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
connection successful
Table user_data created successfully
Database ALX_prodev is present
[('uuid1', 'name1', 'email1', 25), ...]
